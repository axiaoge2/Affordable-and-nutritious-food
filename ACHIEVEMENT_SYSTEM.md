# Achievement System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive achievement system and statistics visualization implemented for the Chihao (吃好) food recommendation app. The system tracks user behavior, unlocks achievements based on milestones, and visualizes statistics through interactive charts and badges.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Achievement System (成就系统)

#### Achievement Categories

**Exploration (探索类)**
- `first-draw`: 初次尝试 - Complete first blind box draw
- `food-explorer-10/50/100`: 美食探险家 I/II/III - Try 10/50/100 different foods
- `all-categories`: 全类型收集 - Try all food categories
- `rare-hunter`: 稀有猎人 - Draw high-value food (score ≥ 9.0)

**Activity (活跃度类)**
- `streak-3/7/30`: 连续签到 I/II/III - Use app for 3/7/30 consecutive days
- `draw-master-50/100/500`: 抽取达人 I/II/III - Total 50/100/500 draws
- `emotion-feedback-20/50/100`: 反馈积极者 I/II/III - Provide 20/50/100 emotion feedbacks

**Preference Learning (偏好学习类)**
- `preference-mastery`: 口味明确 - Preference model maturity threshold reached
- `picky-foodie`: 挑剔的美食家 - Both likes and dislikes reach 20 each

#### Rarity Levels

Each achievement has a rarity that affects visual presentation:
- **Common** (普通): Gray border, basic rewards

## Technical Implementation

### Data Persistence

All data stored in LocalStorage with these keys:

```javascript
'chihao_user_stats'                  // UserStats object
'chihao_achievement_notifications'   // Last 10 achievement notifications
'chihao_history'                     // Draw history (existing)
'chihao_user_preference'             // User preferences (existing)
```

### Key Files Created

#### Type Definitions
- `src/types/achievement.ts`: Achievement, UserStats, AchievementNotification types

#### Data Configuration
- `src/data/achievements.ts`: Achievement definitions with 17 predefined achievements

#### Business Logic
- `src/utils/achievementEngine.ts`: Core achievement tracking and unlock logic
  - `loadUserStats()`: Load user stats from LocalStorage
  - `updateUserStats()`: Recalculate all stats and achievement progress
  - `checkNewAchievements()`: Compare old vs new state to find newly unlocked
  - `recordVisit()`: Track daily visits for consecutive day calculation
- `src/utils/statsCalculator.ts`: Statistics aggregation and transformation

#### UI Components
- `src/components/AchievementPanel.tsx`: Main achievement display container
- `src/components/AchievementBadge.tsx`: Individual badge component with animations
- `src/components/AchievementDetailModal.tsx`: Full achievement details modal
- `src/components/AchievementUnlockNotification.tsx`: Celebration notification
- `src/components/StatsCard.tsx`: Reusable animated statistics card
- `src/components/StatsChart.tsx`: Recharts pie chart wrapper

### Integration Points

Updated `src/App.tsx`:
- Import achievement system modules
- Add state for `userStats` and `latestAchievement`
- Record visit on app mount
- Check achievements after all user actions
- Render AchievementPanel and AchievementUnlockNotification

### Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "recharts": "^3.3.0"
}
```

Recharts chosen for:
- Native React implementation
- TypeScript support
- Lightweight bundle size
- Extensive chart types
- Responsive design

## Performance Optimizations

### Animation Performance

- GPU-accelerated transforms (scale, rotate, translate, opacity)
- `will-change` property on animated elements
- Staggered animations with 50-100ms delays
- Particle count limits (8-12 particles)

### Data Optimization

- Max 50 history items stored
- Achievement notifications limited to last 10
- Stats calculated on-demand, not stored redundantly
- Memoized components where appropriate

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first grid layout (1 column → 2 → 3)
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Scrollable panels for long content
- Adaptive particle counts on low-end devices

## Animation Details

### Achievement Badge Animations

**Unlocked Badges:**
- Icon: Infinite rotation (-10° → +10°) + scale (1 → 1.1)
- Shine: Sweeping gradient every 3 seconds
- Hover: Scale 1.05 + lift 5px
- Progress bar: Smooth width animation

**Locked Badges:**
- Reduced animations
- Grayscale filter
- Opacity 30%

### Panel Transitions

- **Entry**: Fade + slide from bottom (spring animation)
- **Exit**: Fade + slide to bottom
- **Stats Cards**: Stagger entry with 0.1s delay between cards
- **Badge Grid**: Individual badges animate in with delay = index × 0.05s

### Celebration Effects

When achievement unlocks:
1. Confetti particles spawn (dual explosions)
2. Notification slides down from top with spring physics
3. Achievement icon rotates 360° continuously
4. Background particles pulse and fade
5. Shine effect sweeps across card

## User Experience Flow

### First-Time User
1. Draw first food → "初次尝试" achievement unlocks
2. Notification appears with celebration
3. Can click header button to view all achievements
4. Sees most achievements locked with progress indicators

### Returning User

- Gradients: Multi-color (purple-pink-blue range)
- Border radius: 24-32px (rounded-3xl)

## Performance Metrics

Expected performance:
- Achievement check: < 5ms
- Stats recalculation: < 10ms
- Panel render: < 50ms
- Badge animation: 60fps smooth
- LocalStorage write: < 5ms

## Known Limitations
